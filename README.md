# Cats vs Dogs Classification

## **Introduction**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a technique within the broader Deep Learning field, have been a revolutionary force in Computer Vision applications, especially in the past half-decade or so. One main use-case is that of image classification, e.g. determining whether a picture is that of a dog or catðŸ¥°.

You don't have to limit yourself to a binary classifier of course; CNNs can easily scale to thousands of different classes, as seen in the well-known ImageNet dataset of 1000 classes, used to benchmark computer vision algorithm performance.

In the past couple of years, these cutting edge techniques have started to become available to the broader software development community. Industrial strength packages such asÂ [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)Â have given us the same building blocks that Google uses to write deep learning applications for embedded/mobile devices to scalable clusters in the cloud --Â *Without having to handcode the GPU matrix operations, partial derivative gradients, and stochastic optimizers that make efficient applications possible.*

On top of all of this, are user-friendly APIs such asÂ [Keras](https://keras.io/)Â that abstract away some of the lower level details and allow us to focus on rapidly prototyping a deep learning computation graph.

### **Project Description**

As an introductory project for myself, I have tried Binary-Image-Classification of Cats vs Dogs dataset.

  The total images are as follows :
  Total training cat images : 8750
  Total training dog images : 8750
  Total validation cat images : 3750
  Total validation dog images : 3750
**The dataset is from kaggle**

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to get hands-on with TensorFlow and get used to the syntax.

### **Approach**

  -CNN model using 'relu' and 'sigmoid'.
  -Classification and loss as 'binary-crossentropy'

### **Run The Model**

  To run the model on your device , open the code in python compiler (Jupeter noteook/colab).
  Now run the Predict section of the code and upload the image from your device or from URL.

### **Results**

After tuning a hard-coded model the accuracy of the model in test reached till 85%

  The Model and Project both are not yet fully optimised and the work is in Progress. Surely open to help & Ideas !
